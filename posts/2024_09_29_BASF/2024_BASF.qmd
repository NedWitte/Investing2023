**BASF-  "Badische Anilin- und Sodafabrik"**

BASF is a large chemistry producer headquartered in Ludwigshafen in the state of Baden-WÃ¼rtenberg.

*A purely financial return perspective:*

BASF has been stagnating for the last 10 years. The stock chart nicely reflects the company's financial accurately. For the last 20 years, the earnings by share fluctuated around -0,10 Cents to plus 2.00 Euros per share nicely reflecting a cyclical chemistry business. However, the share still return a net positive return with dividends and partially buybacks.

*New corporate strategy:*

On 26.09.2024, BASF presented new ambitions. They want to return 12 billion to shareholders from 2025-2028 (a dividend of 2.25 Euros per share). BASF debt level might allow it, however it is still not poised for long-term growth. However, this move might make sense in its current interest rate cutting cycle. 

*A tactical hegde play:*

Personally, I consider BASF as a more defense hedge play. The downside risk might be pretty low. It might return 2-3% in stock price return over the long-term and a high dividend on top. I will consider adding for low prices around 42 Euros which reflects a dividend yield of above 5%.
