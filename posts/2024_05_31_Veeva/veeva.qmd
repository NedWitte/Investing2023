#My bullcase for the stock

Veeva managed to grew revenue by 24% y/y. Compared to Salesforce, which is around 9% growth, this is high growth business. Obviously, the stock deserves a premium. And it has it. Which a EBITA around 0.4B, the stock has a P/E multiple around 55 (EPS of 3.48 to 194 USD shareprice).

With the current AI boom, pharma companies might go into the trial phase way faster. Then, they are in need of Veeva as a CRM. They might be the next boom for this company.
