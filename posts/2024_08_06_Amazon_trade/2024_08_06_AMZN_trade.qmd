I bought on Friday, the 02.08.2024. But unfortunately way to early. Over the weekend, the market dropped a lot. Later known as the "Black Monday of August 2024". The following Tuesday, it stabilized a lot. But at least, I managed to buy only after the job reports on Friday leading the a better entrance price.

On 13.08.2024, the PPI data (producer inflation) for USA came out less strong then expected, thus opening the door for the FED to cute in September. Unclear is by how much (0.25% or 0.5%). Personally, I think they might only hike by 0.25%. I sold my Amazon shares with slight profit on 13.08.2024 after a big day rally. It looked like that AMZN shares are not able to get significantly above 170 USD (I managed to sell exactly there) marking a strong resistance. Until that being resolved, AMZN might be in a trading range between 165 and 170 USD. 


In total, I am planning to get in back at 165 USD.
