**Rexford Industrial**

This company has a very strong focus: Southern California! And I like that very much. Working for pretty global company in the past, I noticed that being super specific in a niche can be very beneficial! This REIT mainly has property in the high demand area of California which high barrier sub-markets and obviously a region that is fulfilled with emerging tech and industrial industries.

#Overview about the company:

Here a screenshot from their past presentation:

What I find particularly interesting is the EPS growth. It goes from 0.36 to 1.12 USD in a 8 year time span:

#My bullcase for the stock

Rexford has a quite conservative leverage and balance sheet. It is comparable to those from Prologis or Stag Industrial with a DEBT to EBITA of roughly 2000% (3year average).Despite that, it managed to grow a little bit faster than other REITs. According to S&P, Fitch or Moody's its Balance Sheet is in the BBB area. I do not necessary trust those Grades, but most likely they know better than me. Its growth should continue with more properties going to market. On top of that, REITs and especially industrial REITs are solar/energy companies now as well (REXR generating over 70k MWH annually). This should be another small tailwind in the upcoming AI energy transition phase.
