# Key take aways for me:

1.  Gross profit return: Autodesk managed to increase the gross profit from 1.5B to 5B over 15 years representing a 8% return per annum:

2.  AI play: I think software like CAD will be able to implement AI tools very early on. This might make engineers and architects more productive and cost-efficient. The customer will pay for it.

I bought this at around 197 Euros in May 2024.
