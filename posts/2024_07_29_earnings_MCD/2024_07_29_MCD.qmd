**McDondalds earnings Q2-2024**

According to the Release (https:[Hyperlink to Q2 Earnings](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/content/dam/sites/corp/nfl/pdf/MCD%20-%20Q2-24%20Earnings%20Release.pdf "Hyperlink to Q2 Earnings")), Q2-2024 had this headline:

**-Consolidated revenues for the quarter were nearly \$6.5 billion, an increase over prior year of about 1% in constant currencies**

**-Systemwide sales\* to loyalty members across 50 loyalty markets were over \$26 billion for the trailing twelve-month period and approximately \$7 billion for the quarter**

**-Diluted earnings per share was \$2.80, a decrease of 11% (10% in constant currencies). Excluding the current year charges described above of \$0.17 per share, diluted earnings per share was \$2.97, a decrease of 6% (5% in constant currencies) when also excluding prior year charges.\*\***

This sounds very disappointing, but shares are trading 2% percent higher in the pre-market. Apparently, MCD tries to lure back consumers for higher dinner discounts.

My thoughts: MCD will struggle a few more quarters before they are on a growing path again. I will try to buy the stock at lower levels around 220USD. Long-term no brainer? I am not sure anymore. I am pretty confident that MCD will always exits and make its profits, however GLP1-drugs (obesity drugs) might actually be big road-blocker. That might block growth until 2030 and rather earlier then later.
