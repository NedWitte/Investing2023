# Valuation:

Microsoft median revenue growth from June 2020 to 2024 was 15.7%. On a 10y frame, the revenue was 93.5B in 2014 and in 2024, it was 245B. Personally, I think we will see a revenue of 500 B in 2034. On a EPS metric, the EPS per share in 2014 was 2.63 USD, and in 2024, it was 11.80 USD. That is roughly 3x. Currently with a share price of 400 USD (27.02.2025), this make a valuation of  36 PE (PEG of 2.12). Based on this, Microsoft is priced at a premium valuation. Based on a 10% EPS growth, we will see an EPS of 29 USD in 2034. Based on a premium valuation of 25x PE, this would deserve a stock price of 725 USD. Including dividends, I am expecting to double the money. Btw, based on a EPS growth of 12%, the EPS would be 34 USD and that would deserve a stock price of 850 USD. I invested in this stock hoping to double the money within 10 years.
