# JP Morgan Industrials Conferences:

This chart is their main message: A long-term EPS growth of 8-12%. And this is what I like. A average growing business giving me a return of at least 8%. That means you can double your money here every 10 years most likely. On top you get a 2% Dividend yield. Institutional investors will hold this stock and for me as a private investor, this gives me a sleep well at night feeling while doubling down every 10y.

# FY 2024 outlook:

Earnings Q1 2024:
![HON_earnings_outlook_FY24](HON_earnings_outlook_FY24.PNG) 

Do they keep what they promise? Well, in 1Q 2024 they actually beat their guidance of 2.12-2.22$ by 0.03$. Great start! Organic sales growth is roughly 3%. More interestingly, in FY guidance, they promise up to 6B in Free cash flow  (13% growth). This is solid and a nice growth. They definetly justify their higher PE around 20. I am a buyer here and I will make it roughly 3% of my whole portfolio!
