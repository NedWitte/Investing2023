    "text": "McDondalds earnings Q2-2024\nAccording to the Release (https:Hyperlink to Q2 Earnings), Q2-2024 had this headline:\n-Consolidated revenues for the quarter were nearly $6.5 billion, an increase over prior year of about 1% in constant currencies\n-Systemwide sales* to loyalty members across 50 loyalty markets were over $26 billion for the trailing twelve-month period and approximately $7 billion for the quarter\n-Diluted earnings per share was $2.80, a decrease of 11% (10% in constant currencies). Excluding the current year charges described above of $0.17 per share, diluted earnings per share was $2.97, a decrease of 6% (5% in constant currencies) when also excluding prior year charges.**\nThis sounds very disappointing, but shares are trading 2% percent higher in the pre-market. Apparently, MCD tries to lure back consumers for higher dinner discounts.\nMy thoughts: MCD will struggle a few more quarters before they are on a growing path again. I will try to buy the stock at lower levels around 220USD. Long-term no brainer? I am not sure anymore. I am pretty confident that MCD will always exits and make its profits, however GLP1-drugs (obesity drugs) might actually be big road-blocker. That might block growth until 2030 and rather earlier then later.\n\nStocks charts within a tab\n\n\nChart since inceptionChart of the last year"

It is comparable to those from Prologis or Stag Industrial with a DEBT to EBITA of roughly 2000% (3year average).Despite that, it managed to grow a little bit faster than other REITs. According to S&P, Fitch or Moody’s its Balance Sheet is in the BBB area. I do not necessary trust those Grades, but most likely they know better than me. Its growth should continue with more properties going to market. On top of that, REITs and especially industrial REITs are solar/energy companies now as well (REXR generating over 70k MWH annually). This should be another small tailwind in the upcoming AI energy transition phase."

Let’s first check out their stock prices since January 2023:\n\nStocks charts within a tab\n\n\nChart since inceptionChart of the last year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: Prediction Amazon Earnings Mar2024\n\n\n\n\nChart wise the picture is obvious. Meta Platforms had a great run trippling their price while Amazon roughly doubled. Apple and tesla barely had any stock chart improvements. Especially Tesla used to run way higher and its downfall might be well dramatized. FSD might come up within the next 2 years as predicted from the Youtube channel “electric viking”. Apple was reported to use Microsofts OpenAI for its product (which I doubt since they are prone to have the best vertical integration of AI upon everyone).\nNow lets check what is predicted for Amazon and Apple this week.\nAmazon Earnings:\n\n\n\nmetric\nyear ago\ncurrent quarter\nnext quarter\n\n\n\n\navg. EPS\n0.31\n0.83\n0.94\n\n\navg. revenue\n113.91B\n142.47B\n150.07B\n\n\nforward PE\n39.53\n42.55\nNA\n\n\n\nAmazon usually even beats their earnings. I am highly confident that they will deliver again in Q1 2024 with strong AWS growth. Earnings trading is always a gamble, but I predict that it will increase by 5% after hours!\nNow Apple:\nApple Earnings\n\n\n\nmetric\nyear ago\ncurrent quarter\nnext quarter\n\n\n\n\navg. EPS\n1.52\n1.50\n1.31\n\n\navg. revenue\n90.04B\n94.84B\n87.09B\n\n\nforward PE\n27\n25.8\nNA\n\n\n\nApple does not grow since mid 2022 for various reasons. In short, people hold on to their devices (iPhone, Mac) for way longer.\n\n\n\nApple revenue change per year\n\n\nBut that does not mean that Apple still makes lots of cash. Actually, Apple increased their Gross Profit margin to 44% and expects an Operating income over 30B this quarter. But its very hard to imagine a big suprise here. China sales might get finally better. I personally think that the earnings on thursday do not have a big impact after hours trading."

    "text": "Trends for 2024\n1. AI: Obviously computational intelligence will drive the next year. It’s hype will most likely peak in 2024 Semester 1. There will be tons of overrated companies selling or marketing the idea of AI. The question is which companies will last. For sure Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Facebook, etc. will be a vital role in implementing ideas. But there will be plenty of small sized companies trying to raise money and funding by selling the idea of AI. But my prediction is that only 5% of those smaller capped companies will actually make a profitable business concept with this.\n2. Air traffic: The tourism recovery after the covid pandemic stopp will slowly recover and maybe outgrow the volume of 2019.\n3. The richer are getting richer: 2024 might also be the year where middle class living costs are peaking. The middle class in USA and EU suffered enough the last years. They might not longer accept that a person with a 100k income pays more taxes (independent of USA vs Europe) on its income than the multi-millionaire.\n4. Luxury market: The premium product market might continue to outperform other sectors again. And this is directly connected to trend number 3. The rich still have plenty of disposible wealth. And since you can not be happiness, they might be as well a new “Channel” handbag.\n5. Phone and media addiction: Kids nowadays grow up with a phone and by the age of 16, they already have a Instragram, Snapchat, Tiktok and whatever account. On those platfarms, most people (not only kids for sure) are spending more than 3h per day. 3h per idea is nearly 25% of our active daytime (lets say 16h awake time). Phones and media decreased our attention spane by a lot. I notice this on myself as well of course. But thank god AI is componesating our less efficient work equally, if not even better. But investor-vise, this might be quite obvious. So much of our attention goes to media and this is how humans spend accordingly. Back the days, the typical dad bought his cars based on TV advertisements, now its what is shown between Instagram reels.\n\n\nTop performers for 2024\n1. Alphabet: Google launched Gemini. And this is only the start. There is beautiful ideas of implementing it in science. The executives will announced the news according to the stock price.\n2. LVHM: Like previously said, the rich have disposible income to spend on. LVHM and Hermes are the go-to products\n3. Novo Nordisk: This company has already Ozempic (GLP1 inhibitor) on the market. But that is not it. They might bring the same product on the market as a pill. This might boost the profit even more.\n4. Walt Disney: The media giant might be a turn-around in 2024. Every giant needs to go down before going up (look at Intel in 2023). I believe Walt disney has unique selling point and brand. They kind of lost the battle with Netflix, but there theme markets will stay unbeatable.\n5. Alibaba: Never forget China! Alibaba is making a decent continous quarterly profit and is even willing to pay a small dividend. That is what Western investor appreciate! Another candidate for a nice turn around!"

But at least, I managed to buy only after the job reports on Friday leading the a better entrance price.\nOn 13.08.2024, the PPI data (producer inflation) for USA came out less strong then expected, thus opening the door for the FED to cute in September. Unclear is by how much (0.25% or 0.5%). Personally, I think they might only hike by 0.25%. I sold my Amazon shares with slight profit on 13.08.2024 after a big day rally. It looked like that AMZN shares are not able to get significantly above 170 USD (I managed to sell exactly there) marking a strong resistance. Until that being resolved, AMZN might be in a trading range between 165 and 170 USD.\nIn total, I am planning to get in back at 165 USD."

    "text": "Thoughts from 22.08.2024:\nTesla is a great company, but it does not deserve this multiple. Its CEO Elon Musk is totally going mental and he is more like holywood figure than a good CEO. He focuses more and getting the 15th child with the 15th woman instead of giving the right timelines for the Robotaxi. I think the robotaxi event in October 2024 might not fulfil its promises. For years the Tesla stock gave extraordinary ROIs, however the patience is pretty stretched since 2020. It might be time for a sell of and Tesla might return to a normal valuation. The net profit for 2024 might be only 10 B. Given a multiple of 25, this stock only deserve a valuation of 250 B (currently roughly 700B). Clearly a dangerous situation to be in as an investor. The Tesla Management got to keep its promises regarding energy transition and Full-self driving.\nHere the chart:"

It will show where AI will end up in a phase where people fear a soft landing or a recession. Last quarter, NVIDIA made 26B in revenue with a net income of nearly 15B. Growth is expected to slow that but the Street estimates 31-33B in revenue. Traders are positioned +/- 10% on the down or upsides. For most people its not smart to anticipate any earnings movement here. I personally will go into the earnings with earnings META. META might be the first beneficiary of AI and LLM. Zuckerberg has a great understanding of what AI can do in the short- and long term. My thoughts: There might not be such a strong movement as anticipated. Traders are already strongly positioned and willing to be the stock at lower levels. This signals to me that NOTHING will come with surprises on that Wednesday evening. Chances are more on the upside than downside and the market went down in advance (QQQ at 471.86 as of recording) opening door for a Thursday +3% rally."
