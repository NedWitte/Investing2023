In my opinion, they are clearly a market leading in NMR and EPR spectroscopy, Preclinical imaging, Biotypers, NIR, X-ray and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).\nA purely financial return perspective:\nFrom September 2014 to September 2024, this stock managed to return 14% p.a. (278% over 10y). The SP500 returned 7.7% or 111% over the same period. The dividend for BRKR is very minimal and only 0.05 per quarter (0.20 USD for 2024). Its close peer ThermoFisher Scientific managed to return 417% over the same period (btw as a comparison the high flyer GOOGL returned 445%). However, Thermo followed a more aggressive financial M&A strategy that definetly paid of during a time a low interest rates. I believe that from 2024-2034 Bruker might have a better return since its internal structure are more organized."

Apparently, MCD tries to lure back consumers for higher dinner discounts.\nMy thoughts: MCD will struggle a few more quarters before they are on a growing path again. I will try to buy the stock at lower levels around 220USD. Long-term no brainer? I am not sure anymore. I am pretty confident that MCD will always exits and make its profits, however GLP1-drugs (obesity drugs) might actually be big road-blocker.

He stands for disruption….clearly something the citizen was looking for. Anyway, the market liked it. The days after the results, the SP500 gained and the technical bullish chart is intact.\n\n\n\nCandle chart as of 25 November 2024\n\n\nOn top of that, Trump continues to signal a pro-business environment such as a less-regulatory burden for Full-Self-Driving cars (Musk, Tesla).\nNonetheless, everything Trump wants to implement is highly inflationary. And that might be exactly the mechanism that ruins Trump’s image. Obviously, everyone hates inflation. Despite higher wages, it just makes you feel weaker independent of your income situation.\n\nWhat might happen in the next 5 years with Trump as a president:\n\nsentiment towards Trump will gradually decrease and swing towards a negative picture. The end of 2024 might be the highest popularity Trump will ever see and most likely never see again. Inflation will spike in 2025 and 2026.\nEurope will face huge problems, not only the on the Ukraine front, but also economically. The EU needs China, but also needs USA. It will stay caught up in the middle. Strong political leadership might be able to find good deals in negotiations. Still a waking-up punch that EU policies need.\nEV and FSD transition continues and will speed up.\nBig Tech will continue to compound nicely."

However, the market the day after opened by the biggest up-gap since 2008. Interestingly, in that very scenario the market turned first up but then later down and only recovered in late-2009 with its bottom in Feb 2009. In the 2024 scenario, the FED tried to get ahead of anything. The economy looks robust and basically only the low-income consumers suffers.\n\n\n\n\nFED rates; in grey recessions 19.09.2024\n\n\n\nStatistically, the stock market has a bad second half of September. So far not true for this year. Additionally in election years, the October has bad returns.\nBut I have some other question that came to my mind:\n\nWhy the dollar does not drop in a rate-cutting cycle; why the dollar is strengthening?\nWhy does the 10y-bond yield even increase today?\n\n\nWhat I think right now:\n\nCash is trash —&gt; we need to buy equities (but everyone knows that as well)\nBiontech companies should profit since risk-assets become more attractive\nInvestors will continue to chase yield like REITs\nIndustrial stocks have tons of OPEX and CAPEX —&gt; lowering borrowing costs should help these equities nicely\nregional banks should have a comeback (this one I am not interested in)\ncompanies are planing their budget for 2025 right now —&gt; the 50bp cut comes with perfect timing\n\n\nWhat might happen:\n\nthe initial strong up-move might be followed by tons of sentiment traders\nhowever a drop is always near; we are cutting because of weak signs (remember!)\nI will try to get into specific stocks with reasonable evaluation"

Hard to stockpick here.\nHealthcare: I think Healtcare will have a comeback in 2025\nUS REITS: Those REITs like REXR, VICI, etc. have a low valuation and possibly they deliver 20% in 2025.\nChemistry: Possibly Chemistry companies hit rock-botton in 2024 and they are set for a strong comeback in 2025.\n\n\n\nTop performers for 2025\n\nNVIDIA: I continue to believe that NVIDIA will deliver in 2025, but it will not double in share price. My price target for 2025: 200 USD and then the RSI might fall.\nMerck: Pharma will develop a strong pipeline and defensive stocks will perform nicely when growth fears start.\nRexford Realty: Industrial REIT based in California. Defensive play while the FED lowers interest rates.\nSamsung: Cheap valuation caused by political problems in Korea. This stock might come back strongly with AI features and a strong semiconductors upswing.\nAdobe: AI software play. Adobe only grows 10% which is too few, but possibly their growth accelerates again in 2025."

    "text": "Trends for 2024\n1. AI: Obviously computational intelligence will drive the next year. It’s hype will most likely peak in 2024 Semester 1. There will be tons of overrated companies selling or marketing the idea of AI. The question is which companies will last. For sure Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Facebook, etc. will be a vital role in implementing ideas. But there will be plenty of small sized companies trying to raise money and funding by selling the idea of AI. But my prediction is that only 5% of those smaller capped companies will actually make a profitable business concept with this.\n2. Air traffic: The tourism recovery after the covid pandemic stopp will slowly recover and maybe outgrow the volume of 2019.\n3. The richer are getting richer: 2024 might also be the year where middle class living costs are peaking. The middle class in USA and EU suffered enough the last years. They might not longer accept that a person with a 100k income pays more taxes (independent of USA vs Europe) on its income than the multi-millionaire.\n4. Luxury market: The premium product market might continue to outperform other sectors again. And this is directly connected to trend number 3. The rich still have plenty of disposible wealth. And since you can not be happiness, they might be as well a new “Channel” handbag.\n5. Phone and media addiction: Kids nowadays grow up with a phone and by the age of 16, they already have a Instragram, Snapchat, Tiktok and whatever account. On those platfarms, most people (not only kids for sure) are spending more than 3h per day. 3h per idea is nearly 25% of our active daytime (lets say 16h awake time). Phones and media decreased our attention spane by a lot. I notice this on myself as well of course. But thank god AI is componesating our less efficient work equally, if not even better. But investor-vise, this might be quite obvious. So much of our attention goes to media and this is how humans spend accordingly. Back the days, the typical dad bought his cars based on TV advertisements, now its what is shown between Instagram reels.\n\n\nTop performers for 2024\n1. Alphabet: Google launched Gemini. And this is only the start. There is beautiful ideas of implementing it in science. The executives will announced the news according to the stock price.\n2. LVHM: Like previously said, the rich have disposible income to spend on. LVHM and Hermes are the go-to products\n3. Novo Nordisk: This company has already Ozempic (GLP1 inhibitor) on the market. But that is not it. They might bring the same product on the market as a pill. This might boost the profit even more.\n4. Walt Disney: The media giant might be a turn-around in 2024. Every giant needs to go down before going up (look at Intel in 2023). I believe Walt disney has unique selling point and brand. They kind of lost the battle with Netflix, but there theme markets will stay unbeatable.\n5. Alibaba: Never forget China! Alibaba is making a decent continous quarterly profit and is even willing to pay a small dividend. That is what Western investor appreciate! Another candidate for a nice turn around!\n#Update 02.01.2025:\nPerformance Review: Alphabet made 35%, LVHM -17%, Novo Nordisk -16%, Walt Disney made 23%, Alibaba made 14%. In a equalized portfolio with each stock holding 20%, this portfolio would have made 7.8% and clearly underperforming the market (SP500 made 25%)."

    "text": "Big tech never stops making money? Q1 2024 Earnings thoughts\nLast week Google, Meta and Tesla reported their earnings followed by Amazon and Apple this week. Let’s first check out their stock prices since January 2023:\n\nStocks charts within a tab\n\n\nChart since inceptionChart of the last year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n: Prediction Amazon Earnings Mar2024\n\n\n\n\nChart wise the picture is obvious. Meta Platforms had a great run trippling their price while Amazon roughly doubled. Apple and tesla barely had any stock chart improvements. Especially Tesla used to run way higher and its downfall might be well dramatized. FSD might come up within the next 2 years as predicted from the Youtube channel “electric viking”. Apple was reported to use Microsofts OpenAI for its product (which I doubt since they are prone to have the best vertical integration of AI upon everyone).\nNow lets check what is predicted for Amazon and Apple this week.\nAmazon Earnings:\n\n\n\nmetric\nyear ago\ncurrent quarter\nnext quarter\n\n\n\n\navg. EPS\n0.31\n0.83\n0.94\n\n\navg. revenue\n113.91B\n142.47B\n150.07B\n\n\nforward PE\n39.53\n42.55\nNA\n\n\n\nAmazon usually even beats their earnings. I am highly confident that they will deliver again in Q1 2024 with strong AWS growth. Earnings trading is always a gamble, but I predict that it will increase by 5% after hours!\nNow Apple:\nApple Earnings\n\n\n\nmetric\nyear ago\ncurrent quarter\nnext quarter\n\n\n\n\navg. EPS\n1.52\n1.50\n1.31\n\n\navg. revenue\n90.04B\n94.84B\n87.09B\n\n\nforward PE\n27\n25.8\nNA\n\n\n\nApple does not grow since mid 2022 for various reasons. In short, people hold on to their devices (iPhone, Mac) for way longer.\n\n\n\nApple revenue change per year\n\n\nBut that does not mean that Apple still makes lots of cash. Actually, Apple increased their Gross Profit margin to 44% and expects an Operating income over 30B this quarter. But its very hard to imagine a big suprise here. China sales might get finally better. I personally think that the earnings on thursday do not have a big impact after hours trading."

He focuses more and getting the 15th child with the 15th woman instead of giving the right timelines for the Robotaxi. I think the robotaxi event in October 2024 might not fulfil its promises. For years the Tesla stock gave extraordinary ROIs, however the patience is pretty stretched since 2020. It might be time for a sell of and Tesla might return to a normal valuation. The net profit for 2024 might be only 10 B. Given a multiple of 25, this stock only deserve a valuation of 250 B (currently roughly 700B). Clearly a dangerous situation to be in as an investor.

They have nice AI opportunities in Self-driving cars and Life science as well as their core business of advertisment.

According to S&P, Fitch or Moody’s its Balance Sheet is in the BBB area. I do not necessary trust those Grades, but most likely they know better than me. Its growth should continue with more properties going to market. On top of that, REITs and especially industrial REITs are solar/energy companies now as well (REXR generating over 70k MWH annually).
