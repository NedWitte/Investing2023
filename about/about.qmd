This is my little side project in order to learn some more coding. I also like to write down some thoughts here that I am going to review in the past.

This website is created with Quarto, which is a great tool to make data public as well as combing R, Python and html code (Learn more about Quarto [here](https://www.quarto.com).)

Its me newest passion to follow financials news, watch Bloomberg and trying to understand the psychology of financial markets. After years, I figured out how portfolio managers are managing. Since I am a retail investor, I figured partly out when to shine and when to be greedy. In simple terms: "Be greedy when there is blood on the streets". But this is easier said then done. I am pretty much already happy, when I make 60% of my choice correct.

Here a photo from a sunrise from the financial hub of the world:
