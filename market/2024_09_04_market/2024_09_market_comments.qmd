**September 2024**

Historically, the September is not a good month in terms of stock returns. That means: perfect time to buy:

The 03rd of September was already a strong sell-off. However, I do not think 2024 will end the bull market for technology stocks. Instead I consider it a strong buy the dip opportunity.

Same for the broader SP500. They pullback of the beginning of September might be very much a short buying window. Big tech earnings in October will bring in positiv sentiment. My target 6000 by Q1 2025.
