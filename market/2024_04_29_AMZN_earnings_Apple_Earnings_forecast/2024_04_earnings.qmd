**Big tech never stops making money? Q1 2024 Earnings thoughts**

Last week Google, Meta and Tesla reported their earnings followed by Amazon and Apple this week. Let's first check out their stock prices since January 2023:

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

# Download stock price data for the specified symbols and date range
getSymbols(ticker_symbols, from = start_date, to = end_date)


ticker_symbols <- c(ticker_symbol_1, ticker_symbol_2, ticker_symbol_3, ticker_symbol_4, ticker_symbol_5) # fill in all ticker symbols


#merge
dfs <- lapply(ticker_symbols, function(sym) data.frame(Date = index(get(sym)), coredata(get(sym))))
merged_data <- Reduce(function(x, y) left_join(x, y, by = "Date"), dfs) # by date


```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false


# Select the columns of interest (7, 13, and 19) and the Date column
selected_data <- merged_data %>% select(Date, 7, 13, 19, 25, 31)

# Calculate the relative values by dividing each column by its initial value
selected_data_normalized <- selected_data %>%
  mutate(across(-Date, ~ . / .[1])) 


plot1 <- plot_ly(selected_data_normalized, x = ~Date) %>%

: Prediction Amazon Earnings Mar2024
:::
:::

Chart wise the picture is obvious. Meta Platforms had a great run trippling their price while Amazon roughly doubled. Apple and tesla barely had any stock chart improvements. Especially Tesla used to run way higher and its downfall might be well dramatized. FSD might come up within the next 2 years as predicted from the Youtube channel "electric viking". Apple was reported to use Microsofts OpenAI for its product (which I doubt since they are prone to have the best vertical integration of AI upon everyone).

Now lets check what is predicted for Amazon and Apple this week.

Amazon Earnings:

| metric       | year ago | current quarter | next quarter |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| avg. EPS     | 0.31     | 0.83            | 0.94         |
| avg. revenue | 113.91B  | 142.47B         | 150.07B      |
| forward PE   | 39.53    | 42.55           | NA           |

Amazon usually even beats their earnings. I am highly confident that they will deliver again in Q1 2024 with strong AWS growth. Earnings trading is always a gamble, but I predict that it will increase by 5% after hours!

Now Apple:

Apple Earnings

| metric       | year ago | current quarter | next quarter |
|--------------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| avg. EPS     | 1.52     | 1.50            | 1.31         |
| avg. revenue | 90.04B   | 94.84B          | 87.09B       |
| forward PE   | 27       | 25.8            | NA           |

Apple does not grow since mid 2022 for various reasons. In short, people hold on to their devices (iPhone, Mac) for way longer.

But that does not mean that Apple still makes lots of cash. Actually, Apple increased their Gross Profit margin to 44% and expects an Operating income over 30B this quarter. But its very hard to imagine a big suprise here. China sales might get finally better. I personally think that the earnings on thursday do not have a big impact after hours trading.
