**Februar 2025**

Trumps wants to imposs a lot of things, but what can we take seriously? This is how BingAI summarized it for me:

President Donald Trump has imposed several tariffs on Europe, focusing on various sectors:

1.  **Auto Tariffs**: Trump has proposed tariffs "in the neighborhood of 25%" on European automobiles.

2.  **Semiconductors and Pharmaceuticals**: Similar duties are being considered for semiconductor and pharmaceutical imports1.

3.  **Reciprocal Tariffs**: The administration has shifted to a strategy of reciprocal tariffs, where the U.S. matches the import duties levied by other countries.

These measures are part of a broader strategy to address trade imbalances and protect U.S. industries. However, they have also led to economic concerns and defensive measures from the European Union.

Now lets jump to the geopolitcal question regarding Ukraine:

1.  **Peace Plan**: The Trump administration has proposed a three-stage peace plan, which includes a ceasefire and elections in Ukraine1. This plan has been criticized by some as being overly favorable to Russia1.

2.  **Territorial Concessions**: Leaked details suggest that the plan may require Ukraine to recognize Russian sovereignty over certain occupied territories.

3.  **Sanctions and Tariffs**: Trump has threatened to impose high levels of taxes, tariffs, and sanctions on Russia if a deal is not reached.

4.  **NATO Membership**: The plan does not foresee NATO membership for Ukraine, suggesting instead a non-NATO mission for peacekeeping.

**What might happen after:**

-   Inflation goes up....especially for drugs in the USA; US housing market collapses
-   EU will be forced to issue tons of new debt to boost the economy
-   Ukraine will be split into two parts and the EU will not be pleased with the results
-   for stocks: I think US Tech might the safest sector to be invested in
