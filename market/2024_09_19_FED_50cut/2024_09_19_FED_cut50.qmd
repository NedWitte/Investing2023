**September 2024**

Update 26.09.2024:

The market slowly continues to slowly go higher. The Swiss central bank SNB also cuts by 25 bps.

Update 19.09.2024: The FED cuts by 50 BP. Rates will be at 4.75% to 5.00% soon. The ECB already cutted in EU zone interest rate to 3.50% last week.

Initially, the stock market had barely reactions were pretty insignificant. However, the market the day after opened by the biggest up-gap since 2008. Interestingly, in that very scenario the market turned first up but then later down and only recovered in late-2009 with its bottom in Feb 2009. In the 2024 scenario, the FED tried to get ahead of anything. The economy looks robust and basically only the low-income consumers suffers.

Statistically, the stock market has a bad second half of September. So far not true for this year. Additionally in election years, the October has bad returns.

But I have some other question that came to my mind:

-   Why the dollar does not drop in a rate-cutting cycle; why the dollar is strengthening?
-   Why does the 10y-bond yield even increase today?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What I think right now:**

-   Cash is trash ---\> we need to buy equities (but everyone knows that as well)
-   Biontech companies should profit since risk-assets become more attractive
-   Investors will continue to chase yield like REITs
-   Industrial stocks have tons of OPEX and CAPEX ---\> lowering borrowing costs should help these equities nicely
-   regional banks should have a comeback (this one I am not interested in)
-   companies are planing their budget for 2025 right now ---\> the 50bp cut comes with perfect timing

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**What might happen:**

-   the initial strong up-move might be followed by tons of sentiment traders
-   however a drop is always near; we are cutting because of weak signs (remember!)
-   I will try to get into specific stocks with reasonable evaluation
