## Market Events and Performance

The performance of the S&P 500 is subject to various market events, including economic data releases, corporate earnings reports, geopolitical developments, and central bank decisions. Market fluctuations in the S&P 500 can have a cascading effect on other financial markets and impact investor confidence.

## Long term predictions

For this point, I want to demonstrate two scenarios:

-1. scenario: weak outlook and an average growth of 3% while adding 10k per year

-2. scenario: perfect wealth generation conditions with a growth of 10% while adding 10k per year

Let's take a look at both:

1.  scenario: growth 3% p.a., 10k additional investment from the job income

```{r}
paste0(print("In year 2023 the portfolio has an income of 180k. Today the value is"))
```

2.  scenario: growth 10% p.a. + 10k additional investment from job income
