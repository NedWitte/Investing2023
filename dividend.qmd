## Market Events and Performance

The performance of the S&P 500 is subject to various market events, including economic data releases, corporate earnings reports, geopolitical developments, and central bank decisions. Market fluctuations in the S&P 500 can have a cascading effect on other financial markets and impact investor confidence.

## Long term predictions

For this point, I want to demonstrate two scenarios:

-1. scenario: 200k start, weak performance and an average growth of 5% while adding 10k per year (2% starting dividend yield), taxed with 26% without DRIP:

![5 % growth](data/pictures/Growth_5p_200k.PNG)

In this scenario 1, the portfolio will be worth roughly over 1M with a dividend income of 22k after 25 years.

-2. scenario: 200k start, weak performance and an average growth of 10% while adding 10k per year (2% starting dividend yield), taxed with 26% without DRIP:

![10% growth](data/pictures/Growth_10p_200k.PNG)

In this scenario 2, the portfolio will be worth roughly over 2.5M with a dividend income of 50k after 25 years.
