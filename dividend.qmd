**The KarambolageNed portfolio**

# Introduction

This **portfolio** consist of a maximum of 100 values whereas the top 15 stock should compromise at least 40% of the total value.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyquant)
library(quantmod)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(plotly)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

#get data from the Google sheets 
porfolio_df <- t

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

#prepare figure to plot
fig <- plot_ly(
  labels = sp500_df_top10$symbol,
  values = sp500_df_top10$weight,
  type = "pie",
  textinfo = "label+percent",
  insidetextorientation = "radial",
  sort = FALSE
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Top 10 Stocks by Weight",
  scene = list(
    annotations = list(
      text = sp500_df_top10$company,
      x = 0.5,
      y = 0.5,
      showarrow = FALSE,
      font = list(size = 5)
    )
  )
)

```

```{r}

fig

print(paste("In this portfolio the top 15 stocks compromises roughly", as.character(round(sum(sp500_df_top10$weight[1:10]),3)*100), "%  of the market capitaliztation."))
```

## Strategy

The strategy is easy: Safe and sound.

Generally, this portfolio has the purpose to add a signifcant amount of dividend income to the regular job income.

## Market Events and Performance

The performance of the S&P 500 is subject to various market events, including economic data releases, corporate earnings reports, geopolitical developments, and central bank decisions. Market fluctuations in the S&P 500 can have a cascading effect on other financial markets and impact investor confidence.

## Long term predictions

For this point, I want to demonstrate two scenarios:

-1. scenario: weak outlook and an average growth of 3% while adding 10k per year

-2. scenario: perfect wealth generation conditions with a growth of 10% while adding 10k per year

Let's take a look at both:

1.  scenario: growth 3% p.a., 10k additional investment from the job income

```{r}
paste0(print("In year 2023 the portfolio has an income of 180k. Today the value is", as.character(sum(x))),k)
```

2.  scenario: growth 10% p.a. + 10k additional investment from job income
