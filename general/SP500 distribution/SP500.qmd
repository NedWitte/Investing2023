The monthly dividend stock

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
library(tidyquant)
library(quantmod)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyquant)
library(plotly)

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false

#data preparation
sp500_df <- tq_index("SP500")

sp500_df_top10 <- sp500_df %>%
  arrange(desc(weight)) %>%
  slice(1:10)

# Assuming sp500_df is your original dataframe
sp500_df_top10 <- sp500_df_top10 %>%
  arrange(desc(weight)) %>%
  slice(1:10) %>%
  bind_rows(data.frame(symbol = "Top11-500", company = "Top11-500" ,weight = (1-sum(sp500_df_top10$weight))))


```

This is the distribution of the SP500. Scroll over the plot to get more detailed data.

So it is nicely visible that the top 10 biggest companies by market capitalization are taking 30% of the cake.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(plotly)

# Assuming sp500_df_top10 is your dataframe
fig <- plot_ly(
  labels = sp500_df_top10$symbol,
  values = sp500_df_top10$weight,
  type = "pie",
  textinfo = "label+percent",
  insidetextorientation = "radial",
  sort = FALSE
) %>%
layout(
  title = "Top 10 Stocks by Weight",
  scene = list(
    annotations = list(
      text = sp500_df_top10$company,
      x = 0.5,
      y = 0.5,
      showarrow = FALSE,
      font = list(size = 5)
    )
  )
)
