### **Trends for 2024**

1\. AI: Obviously computational intelligence will drive the next year. It's hype will most likely peak in 2024 Semester 1. There will be tons of overrated companies selling or marketing the idea of AI. The question is which companies will last. For sure Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla, Facebook, etc. will be a vital role in implementing ideas. But there will be plenty of small sized companies trying to raise money and funding by selling the idea of AI. But my prediction is that only 5% of those smaller capped companies will actually make a profitable business concept with this.

2\. Air traffic: The tourism recovery after the covid pandemic stopp will slowly recover and maybe outgrow the volume of 2019.

3\. The richer are getting richer: 2024 might also be the year where middle class living costs are peaking. The middle class in USA and EU suffered enough the last years. They might not longer accept that a person with a 100k income pays more taxes (independent of USA vs Europe) on its income than the multi-millionaire.

4\. Luxury market: The premium product market might continue to outperform other sectors again. And this is directly connected to trend number 3. The rich still have plenty of disposible wealth. And since you can not be happiness, they might be as well a new "Channel" handbag.

5\. Phone and media addiction: Kids nowadays grow up with a phone and by the age of 16, they already have a Instragram, Snapchat, Tiktok and whatever account. On those platfarms, most people (not only kids for sure) are spending more than 3h per day. 3h per idea is nearly 25% of our active daytime (lets say 16h awake time). Phones and media decreased our attention spane by a lot. I notice this on myself as well of course. But thank god AI is componesating our less efficient work equally, if not even better. But investor-vise, this might be quite obvious. So much of our attention goes to media and this is how humans spend accordingly. Back the days, the typical dad bought his cars based on TV advertisements, now its what is shown between Instagram reels.

### **Top performers for 2024**

1\. Alphabet: Google launched Gemini. And this is only the start. There is beautiful ideas of implementing it in science. The executives will announced the news according to the stock price.

2\. LVHM: Like previously said, the rich have disposible income to spend on. LVHM and Hermes are the go-to products

3\. Novo Nordisk: This company has already Ozempic (GLP1 inhibitor) on the market. But that is not it. They might bring the same product on the market as a pill. This might boost the profit even more.

4\. Walt Disney: The media giant might be a turn-around in 2024. Every giant needs to go down before going up (look at Intel in 2023). I believe Walt disney has unique selling point and brand. They kind of lost the battle with Netflix, but there theme markets will stay unbeatable.

5\. Alibaba: Never forget China! Alibaba is making a decent continous quarterly profit and is even willing to pay a small dividend. That is what Western investor appreciate! Another candidate for a nice turn around!

#Update 02.01.2025:

Performance Review: Alphabet made 35%, LVHM -17%, Novo Nordisk -16%, Walt Disney made 23%, Alibaba made 14%. In a equalized portfolio with each stock holding 20%, this portfolio would have made 7.8% and clearly underperforming the market (SP500 made 25%).
