### **Trends for 2025**

1.  AI: AI Software stocks will be able to sell their software nicely. Big tech already started that in 2024.
2.  Seminconductors: Some stocks will continue to perform nicely, but the broader semiconductor market might not. Hard to stockpick here.
3.  Healthcare: I think Healtcare will have a comeback in 2025
4.  US REITS: Those REITs like REXR, VICI, etc. have a low valuation and possibly they deliver 20% in 2025.
5.  Chemistry: Possibly Chemistry companies hit rock-botton in 2024 and they are set for a strong comeback in 2025.

### **Top performers for 2025**

1.  NVIDIA: I continue to believe that NVIDIA will deliver in 2025, but it will not double in share price. My price target for 2025: 200 USD and then the RSI might fall.

2.  Merck: Pharma will develop a strong pipeline and defensive stocks will perform nicely when growth fears start.

3.  Rexford Realty: Industrial REIT based in California. Defensive play while the FED lowers interest rates.

4.  Samsung: Cheap valuation caused by political problems in Korea. This stock might come back strongly with AI features and a strong semiconductors upswing.

5.  Adobe: AI software play. Adobe only grows 10% which is too few, but possibly their growth accelerates again in 2025.
